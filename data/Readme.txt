QUESTIONS PROVIDED IN THE MERGED FILE:
The 1987 to 2012 Values Merge File contains core values questions from 15 surveys conducted between May 1987 and April 2012.  
Not all of the questions from each of the individual surveys are included in the merge file -- only the relevant values questions and associated 
demographic variables.  

The variable labels have been standardized for all the surveys so that the q2 series in the merge file corresponds to the q30 series in the 
2012 Values topline. Likewise, the q10 series in the merge file corresponds to the q30 series, and the q16 series corresponds to the q41 series. 
The wording for the values questions is provided in the "Values Question Codebook 1987-2012.doc" file.  

The demographic variables have been standardized according to the specifications in the "Values Demographics Codebook 1987-2012.doc" file.
